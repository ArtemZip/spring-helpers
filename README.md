Spring Helpers (tmp name)
========

### Description
`Spring helpers` is additional library fro `Spring framework` which provides additional annotations for generation common spring structures (such as repositories, controllers, etc).

### Architecture
This project contains three modules:
- **annotations-lib** - contains only annotations which will be used in processors
- **processors-lib** - contains processors which creates codes according to your annotation usage
- **experiment** - temporary module, which will be used for testing during developing

### Example
By the help of `@JpaRepositoty` will be created same named structure for your entities, which you will easily inject in your spring project.
Moreover, you will be able to specify custom methods by additional annotation `@Method`

##### Example of entity
```java
@Entity
@JpaRepository({
    @Method(name = "findAllByName", returnType = List.class, args = {String.class}),
    @Method(name = "findAllByNameAndId", returnType = List.class, args = {String.class, Long.class}),
    @Method(name = "getNameById", returnType = String.class, args = {Long.class}, query = "Select u.name from ExampleEntity u where u.id = ?1")
})
public class ExampleEntity {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    
    //geters & setters
}
```

##### Example of generated code
```java
public interface ExampleEntityRepository extends JpaRepository<ExampleEntity, Long> {
  
  List<ExampleEntity> findAllByName(String arg0);

  List<ExampleEntity> findAllByNameAndId(String arg0, Long arg1);

  @Query("Select u.name from ExampleEntity u where u.id = ?1")
  String getNameById(Long arg0);
}
```

### Problems
- doesn't exist direct access to annotated class, therefore there is no simple way to get class properties .
- doesn't exist easy way to update annotated class, in this way should be used `AST` (Abstract syntax tree).
- creating some classes could be too complicated to code (for instance, generic classes full of methods which directs to parameter or annotated class), as a possible solution will be added additional module with custom templating engine, which perform transformations from prepared code-templates to java classes.

### Provided annotations 
- [`@JpaRepository`][jpa-repository] - creates interface of JpaRepository<Entity,Id>
- [`@RestCrudController`][rest-crud-controller] - creates spring RestController with CRUD methods (validation will be provided)
- `@CrudController` - creates spring Controller with CRUD methods (validation will be provided)
- `@CrudOperations` - inserts to existing (Rest)Controller CRUD methods (validation will be provided)
- _TODO: think about other structures_

### Dependencies
- `Javapoet` - library for easier way to write java classes in time of processing
- `Spring framework` - source of data structures which will be generated by processing
